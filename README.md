## How to Contribute
### For New Users

If you wish to add documentation to the ACCESS-Hive Docs website check the [contribution guide](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/) for instructions.

### For [ACCESS-NRI GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI) members

The ACCESS-Hive Docs website is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). For detailed information on markdown syntax and different features, please refer to [mkdocs-material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).
The suggested workflow for a contribution on the ACCESS-Hive Docs is detailed below:

#### 1. Clone the ACCESS-Hive Docs GitHub repo

To clone the [ACCESS-Hive Docs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-hive.org.au) GitHub repo, run the following command in your local terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-NRI/access-hive.org.au.git
```
#### 2. Raise an issue about the contribution

Before working on a contribution, it is always good practice to have a GitHub issue detailing the content of the contribution and why it is important. 
If not already present, open a [new issue](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-hive.org.au/issues/new?template=simple-issue-template.md) about your contribution.

#### 3. Create a new git branch

Create a new `git` branch for your new contribution, starting from the `development` branch.
A suggested way to call it is in the format `<name>/<issue-summary>-<issue-number>`, for example `jasmeen/improve-how-to-contribute-812`:
```
git checkout -b jasmeen/improve-how-to-contribute-812 origin/development
```

#### 4. Make changes, commit and push to the remote repo

While you are in your new `git` branch, make your desired changes, commit your changes, and push the commits to the remote repo: 

```
# Stage the desired files
git add ...

# Commit the changes, including a meaningful commit descriptions.
# Avoid general descriptions, such as 'a fix', 'useful change', 'home page bug fixes' etc.
git commit -m "Improved how-to-contribute instructions in the README."

# Push the changes to the remote
git push 
```

> [!TIP]
> When you push your new `git` branch to the remote for the first time, you will need to set its upstream with:
> ```
> git push --set-upstream origin jasmeen/improve-how-to-contribute-812
> ```

Repeat these steps as many times as you want, until you are satisfied with all the changes and you are ready for your contribution to be reviewed.

#### 4. Deploy website preview

During development, you can preview the changes made using [MkDocs live preview server](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/#deploying-website-preview).

#### 5. Keep your branch in sync with the `development` branch

Sometimes, while you make changes for your contribution, other commits can be added to the upstream (remote) `development` branch. 
It is good practice to always keep your branch in sync with the latest updates of the `development` branch, before opening a Pull Request and have your contribution reviewed.
For syncing your feature branch with the upstream `development` branch, use the following 
command: 

```
git rebase origin/development jasmeen/improve-how-to-contribute-812
```

> [!WARNING]
> After rebasing, you might have to resolve conflicts.
> Also, to push commits of a local branch after rebasing you might need to use `git push --force-with-lease` (`--force-with-lease` is a safer alternative to `--force`).
> For these reasons, always use `git rebase` carefully. Don't hesitate to have a chat with the Hive Docs team if unsure :smile:

#### 6. Open a Pull Request

Once you are happy with your contribution, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to have it reviewed by the ACCESS-Hive Docs team.
Feel free to assign `ACCESS-NRI/WebOps` team as reviewers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ACCESS-Hive Docs repo's default branch is `development`. The `main` branch is automatically updated daily by merging the `development` branch.

## Styling guidelines for developers

Please follow the guidelines below to make the Hive Docs consistent among all the pages contributed by different people. 

- Always prefer Markdown syntax to HTML when possible;
- All internal URLs need to be ABSOLUTE links, starting with `/` which indicates the base website `https://docs.access-hive.org.au/`. So, a reference to the page `https://docs.access-hive.org.au/models/configurations/access-cm/` will be `/models/configurations/access-cm`. Also, all assets need to be linked starting with `/assets/...`. This because currently the link checker does not handle relative links properly.
- Titles/subtitles should NOT include: code lines/blocks, bold (titles are usually already bold), italic, links;
- Code lines/blocks need to be used for lines/blocks of code, terminal commands and file/directory paths/names;
- Italic needs to be used when referring to specific proper nouns (for example _Gadi_ or _payu_);
- Bold can be used to highlight some words (please do not overuse it);
- All types of admonitions (info, warning, etc.), collapsible and not, can be used as described in the [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/), but they are rendered slightly differently. For the HTML version of them, please refer to the [HTML/Markdown cheatsheet for the Hive Docs](#htmlmarkdown-cheatsheet-for-the-hive-docs).
- Instructions for different versions (for example different operative systems or different model versions) can be rendered using tabs (see [HTML/Markdown cheatsheet for the Hive Docs](#htmlmarkdown-cheatsheet-for-the-hive-docs));
- Terminal input/output examples can be rendered using [animated-terminal.js](https://github.com/atteggiani/animated-terminal.js)

### Styling Markdown using CSS
#### Attribute lists
To style Markdown using custom CSS, you can use [attribute lists](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/) by adding the desired CSS style (in-line or adding classes as defined in the `access-nri.css` file) inside curly brackets (starting with a colon) right after the markdown syntax.

For example, to make an image 50%-wide and with rounded borders, you can write the following:
```
![image text](/image/url/){: style="width: 50%; border-radius: 0.6rem;" }
```
#### Markdown in HTML
You can use [Markdown in HTML](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown/?h=md+in+html#markdown-in-html) by adding the `markdown` attribute inside an HTML tag.<br>
You can then style the HTML tag using CSS (in-line or adding selectors to the `access-nri.css` file).

For example, to render a markdown section with half font-size, you can write the following:
```
<div markdown style="font-size: 0.5em;">
### Section with half font-size (This will appear in the table of content)

- First _bullet_ point
- Second bullet **point**
</div>
```

### Custom HTML tags
Some custom HTML tags were created (in the `js/custom-tags.js` file) to facilitate the rendering of some components.<br>
The following custom tags are available:

- **"Not supported by ACCESS-NRI" admonition**<br>
  The `<custom-not-supported/>` tag renders a preset "Not supported by ACCESS-NRI" admonition.

- **References**<br>
  The `<custom-references> ... </custom-references>` tag renders references to be used at the bottom of a page. Each new line (created by pressing <kbd>return</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd>) inside `...` is rendered as a separate bullet point. A hyphen (`-`) can included at the beginning of a new line (for clarity) but it is stripped off at the time of rendering.<br>
  For example, to reference 2 links you can write:
  ```
  <custom-references>
    - [First reference](first-reference-url)
    - [Second reference](second-reference-url)
  </custom-references>
  ```

- **Simulated terminal info**<br>
  The `<custom-simulated-terminal-info/>` tag renders a preset info admonition on the pages where simulated terminal are used.<br>
  It should not be used manually as it is automatically embedded in the pages containing simulated terminals.

- **Admonitions**<br>
  For information on how to render an [admonition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#usage) please check the respective section in the [HTML/Markdown cheatsheet for the Hive Docs](#htmlmarkdown-cheatsheet-for-the-hive-docs).<br>
  The list of available admonition types is the following:
  - note
  - info
  - danger
  - abstract
  - tip
  - success
  - warning
  - failure
  - question
  - bug
  - example
  - quote
  - supported
  If you want a new admonition type to be created, please raise a [new issue](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-hive.org.au/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=simple-issue-template.md&title=) about it.
