:fontawesome-regular-square-plus:{: class="twemoji icon-before-text nri-blue-color"} [Open a new topic on the Hive Forum and tag it with `help`](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/new-topic?&body=%3Cdiv%20data-theme-toc%3D%22true%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%0A%3C!--%20First%2C%20choose%20an%20appropriate%20category%20for%20your%20request%20-%20if%20you%20aren%27t%20sure%2C%20leave%20it%20as%20General!%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20Description%20of%20request%3A%0A%0A%23%23%20Environment%3A%0A%0A%3C!--%20NCI%3F%20ARE%3F%20gadi%20login%20node%20or%20PBS%20job%3F%20--%3E%0A%0A%3C!--%20List%20software%20versions%20if%20relevant.%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20What%20executed%3A%0A%0A%3C!--%20copy%20and%20paste%20any%20commands%20and%20output%20in%20a%20code%20block%20--%20%3E%0A%3C--%20for%20code%20you%20are%20writing%2C%20prepare%20a%20minimal%20reproducible%20example%20(https%3A%2F%2Fforum.access-hive.org.au%2Fdocs%3Ftopic%3D843)%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20Actual%20results%3A%0A%0A%3C!--%20Copy%20full%20error%20messages%20if%20relevant%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20Expected%20results%3A%0A%0A%23%23%20Additional%20info%3A&category_id=4&tags=help)<br>



### What happens next?
By asking your question on the ACCESS-Hive Forum, it means that anyone in the community can help answer.

:fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass:{: class="twemoji icon-before-text nri-orange-color"} The ACCESS-NRI Support Team monitors and triages all topics with the `help` tag on a regular basis. Many community members also monitor new topics in categories and with tags relevant to them.

:material-tag:{: class="twemoji icon-before-text nri-orange-color"} ACCESS-NRI Support Team will add the `#access-nri-help` tag if the request is for something directly related to ACCESS-NRI-supported tools/models/activities. Otherwise, they will tag with `#community-help` to indicate that this question is best answered by the community.

:fontawesome-solid-users:{: class="twemoji icon-before-text nri-orange-color"} If tagged with `#access-nri-help`, the ACCESS-NRI Support Team will find a helper to assign themselves to the topic and they will follow the request through to a resolution. If tagged with `#community-help`, the ACCESS-NRI Support Team will, if they can, point you to any known resources or community members who might be able to help.

### Private help option
If you'd prefer to ask your question more privately, you can do so by [creating a private help request](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/new-message?&body=%3Cdiv%20data-theme-toc%3D%22true%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20Description%20of%20request%3A%0A%0A%23%23%20Environment%3A%0A%0A%3C!--%20NCI%3F%20ARE%3F%20gadi%20login%20node%20or%20PBS%20job%3F%20--%3E%0A%0A%3C!--%20List%20software%20versions%20if%20relevant.%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20What%20executed%3A%0A%0A%3C!--%20copy%20and%20paste%20any%20commands%20and%20output%20in%20a%20code%20block%20--%20%3E%0A%3C--%20for%20code%20you%20are%20writing%2C%20prepare%20a%20minimal%20reproducible%20example%20(https%3A%2F%2Fforum.access-hive.org.au%2Fdocs%3Ftopic%3D843)%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20Actual%20results%3A%0A%0A%3C!--%20Copy%20full%20error%20messages%20if%20relevant%20--%3E%0A%0A%23%23%20Expected%20results%3A%0A%0A%23%23%20Additional%20info%3A&groupname=Support). This opens a new private message on the ACCESS-Hive Forum with just the ACCESS-NRI Support Team. They will then add a helper to the message to help resolve the request.


### Tips
- Choose a category that best fits your request - this will help the right people see and answer your question! 
  - Note that the above links to create a help request default to the "General" category. 
  - If you're not sure which category to post in, just post in "General"! )
- You can help ensure you get a quick response by including all of the relevant information in your post: [How to write a good help request](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/docs?topic=818)
