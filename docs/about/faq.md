#  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

??? question "What is the difference between the ACCESS-Hive Docs and the ACCESS-Hive Forum?"
    The **ACCESS-Hive Docs** (also referred to as *Hive Docs*) is the website where ACCESS-NRI provides documentation for ACCESS users.

    The **ACCESS-Hive Forum** (also referred to as *Hive Forum*) is the place where the ACCESS user community and its scientific working groups can exchange ideas and provide support.

    !!! warning
        **ACCESS-Hive** (without any other term attached) is an "umbrella" term that includes both the Hive Docs and Hive Forum, but should not be used in place of any of the two, to avoid confusion.

??? question "What is the difference between _model_, _model component_, and _model configuration_?"
    A **model component** (sometimes referred to simply as component) is a codebase that is typically compiled into a single executable. It usually runs independently and communicates with other components via a coupler.

    We refer to **model** as a general descriptive name for a particular combination of model components.
    For example, ACCESS-CM2 has 3 major model components: atmosphere (including land), ocean, and sea-ice. By contrast, ACCESS-OM2 has 2 major model components: ocean and sea-ice, with the atmospheric forcing provided by a data source.

    A **model configuration** is a model (as described above) with a specific configuration (e.g. version, set of parameters) for each of its components.

??? question "What are _Model Runs_ and _Experiments_?"
    A **run** is when a model configuration is executed, usually on an HPC system.

    An **experiment** typically consists of one or multiple separate sequential **runs**, with each **run** picking up where the previous one finished.

    So **experiment** and **run** can sometimes be used as synonyms, but at other times an experiment consists of many runs that are linked by passing model state from one run to the next.

??? question "How do model experiments and model evaluation work together?"

    Climate science - like all science - is based on the comparison of different models and hypothesis with observational data. We provide or support the frameworks to perform such comparisons as part of the **model evaluation**. The different model hypotheses, or more practically speaking *model experiments*, are created by executing different model configurations with different setups; for example by perturbing initial conditions or by adding new physical prescriptions to the models.

??? question "What is a control experiment? Why are they important?"
    A **control experiment** (sometimes also called a "control run") is an experiment that is designed to be used as a comparison against which perturbation experiments can be compared.

    Control experiments are typically designed to represent some neutral climate state. For example, pre-industrial control experiments are designed to represent a modern climate state without significant anthropogenic climate forcing (global warming).

    Control experiments are ideally well equilibrated, so that the model doesn't systematically change (often referred to as "drift").

    Control experiments are important because it is an enormous saving in resources if one control experiment can be used by many researchers. It also means researchers can compare their perturbation experiments against not just the control run, but against each other.

??? question "What is a perturbation experiment?"
    A **perturbation experiment** is when a model configuration from a control experiment is altered in some way. The altered configuration is then run, restarting from a point in the control experiment.

    The perturbation experiment is run in the same way as the control, each successive run using the state (restarts) from the previous run. The perturbation experiment can then be compared with the control experiment to see the effect of the perturbation.

    Perturbation experiments are a very important way to try and understand complex earth systems, e.g. to isolate potential climate change signals and try and understand their effects.

??? question "Where can I find _observational data_ and _model data_?"
    
    Both observational and model data is hosted by the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) under different projects. 

    Go to our [**Observational Data**](/model_evaluation/data/observations) section on the ACCESS-Hive Docs to learn how to find and access observational data.

    Go to our [**Model Data**](/model_evaluation/data/model_catalogs) section on the ACCESS-Hive Docs to learn how to find and access model data.

    In both cases, you need to have access to the specific projects at NCI in order to read the data. For more information, check how to [**Set Up your NCI Account**](/getting_started/set_up_nci_account).

??? question "What is the difference between _teams_ and _working groups_?"

    Throughout this documentation, we use the term **teams** to describe ACCESS-NRI's internal employees.

    By contrast, we refer to **working groups** as the groups of the ACCESS community that work on specific ACCESS components, configurations or research topics. These working groups are formed by the scientific community itself, with ACCESS-NRI liaising between them.
