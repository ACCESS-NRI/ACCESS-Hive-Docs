The ACCESS Ocean Model (ACCESS-OM) is a global coupled ocean model that includes [ocean](/models/model_components/ocean), [ocean biogeochemistry](/models/model_components/bgc_ocean), and [sea ice](/models/model_components/sea-ice) components, linked together by a [coupler](/models/model_components/coupler).<br>
The atmospheric fields that drive the model are provided by a data source, usually derived from reanalysis.

## ACCESS-OM2

[ACCESS-OM2](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/401/2020/) [@Kiss2020] [@ACCESS-OM2-report] [@Solodoch2022] [@Hayashida2023] [@Menviel2023] is a suite of coupled ocean-sea ice models originally developed by the [Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia (COSIMA)](http://cosima.org.au/).<br>

ACCESS-NRI has released [ACCESS-OM2 configurations](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om2-configs) as an adaptation of those originally developed by COSIMA.

There are global configurations for **three spatial resolutions**:

- 1째 horizontal resolution, 50 vertical levels.
- 0.25째 horizontal resolution, 50 vertical levels.
- 0.1째 horizontal resolution, 75 vertical levels.

For each resolution there are **two options of JRA55-do atmospheric forcing**:

- Repeat Year Forcing (RYF): repeated 1 May 1990 - 30 April 1991 forcing
- Interannual Forcing (IAF): 1958-2018 forcing

Each configuration also has an optional biogeochemical (BGC) configuration that uses the [Biogeochemistry Ocean component](/models/model_components/bgc_ocean), if this is required.
!!! warning
    BGC experiments are slower and generally consume more resources (compute time and disk space).
