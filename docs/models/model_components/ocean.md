## Modular Ocean Model (MOM)
The [Modular Ocean Model (MOM)](https://mom-ocean.github.io) is one of the ocean components of the ACCESS climate model systems. Used to simulate ocean currents at both regional and global scales, MOM is an invaluable tool for studying the global ocean climate system, as well as having capabilities for regional and coastal applications. 

MOM is an open source development by a consortium of scientists across several government agencies and academic institutions worldwide. 

### Configurations that use MOM
There are two MOM versions currently used in ACCESS models: [MOM5](https://github.com/mom-ocean/MOM5) and [MOM6](https://github.com/mom-ocean/MOM6).
