## Unified Model (UM)

The UK Met Office [Unified Model (UM)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model) is a numerical model of the atmosphere used for both weather and climate applications across a wide range of temporal scales (nowcasting to centennial) and spatial scales (sub km convective scale to global). The UM includes solutions of the equations of atmospheric fluid dynamics with advanced parameterisations of physical processes like convection, cloud formation and atmospheric radiation. 

### Models that use the UM
- [ACCESS-CM2](/models/access-cm#access-cm2)
- [ACCESS-ESM1.5](/models/access-esm#access-esm15)
- [ACCESS-rAM3](/models/access-ram#access-ram3)

Other ACCESS models used for weather simulations, not supported by ACCESS-NRI, use the UM. Examples are ACCESS-S and ACCESS-C developed by the [Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/).

The UM is also used by international meteorology and research organisations, which contribute towards its development through the [UM partnership](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/foundation-science/um_partnership_handout.pdf).
