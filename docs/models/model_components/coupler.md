A coupler is a software package that allows synchronised exchanges of coupling information between numerical models representing different components of the climate system.

## OASIS3-MCT

[OASIS3-MCT](https://oasis.cerfacs.fr/en/OASIS3-MCT) is the version of the Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil (OASIS) coupler interfaced with the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) from the Argonne National Laboratory. 

### Models that use OASIS3-MCT
- [ACCESS-CM2](/models/access-cm#access-cm2)
- [ACCESS-ESM1.5](/models/access-esm#access-esm15)
- [ACCESS-OM2](/models/access-om#access-om2)

## NUOPC

The [National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC)](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/nuopc/) interoperability layer defines conventions and a set of generic components for building coupled models using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).

### Models that use NUOPC
NUOPC is not yet included in any ACCESS-NRI-supported configuration, but will be included in ACCESS-OM3, a configuration currently under development.
